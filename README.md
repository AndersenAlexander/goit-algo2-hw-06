# Homework for the topic “Basics of Parallel Computing and the MapReduce Model”

## Task

Write a Python script that loads text from a given URL, analyzes the frequency
of use of words in the text using the MapReduce paradigm, and visualizes the top
words with the highest frequency of use in the text.

### Step-by-step instructions

1. Import the necessary modules (`matplotlib` and others).

2. Take the MapReduce implementation code from the outline.

3. Create a `visualize_top_words` function to visualize the results.

4. In the main code block, get the text by URL, apply MapReduce, and visualize
   the results.

👉🏼 For example, for the top 10 most frequently used words, the graph could look
like this:

### Acceptance criteria

📌Homework acceptance criteria are a prerequisite for the assignment to be
considered by the mentor. If any of the criteria are not met, the homework is
sent by the mentor for revision without grading. If you “just need to clarify”😉
or you are “stuck” at some stage of execution — contact the mentor in Slack).

1. The code successfully loads the text from the specified URL.

2. The code correctly performs word frequency analysis using MapReduce.

3. The visualization displays the top words by frequency of use.

4. The code effectively uses multithreading.

5. The code is readable and complies with PEP 8 standards.

## Preparing and uploading homework

1. Create a public repository `goit-algo2-hw-06`.

2. Complete the assignment and submit it to your repository.

3. Download the working files to your computer and attach them to the LMS in the
   format `zip`. The archive name must be in the format DZ6_NAME.

4. Attach a link to the repository `goit-algo2-hw-06` and submit for
   verification.

## Assessment format

Pass/fail

## Submission format

- Attached repository files in `zip` format with the name DZ6_NAME.

- Link to the repository.
